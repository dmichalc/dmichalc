## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**dmichalc/dmichalc** 
As a life long learner, I have enjoyed improving my technology stack as a part-time student at the University of Alberta. Growing up, I was lucky to have an Apple IIe and I first started coding BASIC. I have a BA from the University of Calgary and I have enjoyed both private and public sector careers. I continue to consult and would like to work more IT related projects.
